# Qolo: FinTech Payments/Billing Case Study

## Overview and Origin

"Demand More" is the tag line for a new start up company in the fintech omnichannel payments and billing space, introducing Qolo (pronounced "ko-lo"). Qolo is a start up company founded in 2018, based in Florida. They are taking on the complexity of the global payments landscape by creating an innovating and efficient payments platform and custom solution approach to meet the individual client needs. 

The founders, all of which have deep experience in traditional payments platforms and solutions, wanted to create a new industry leading platform to simplify B2B payments both foreign (cross-boarder) and domestic. Their idea was to develop a hybrid solution that integrates speed, simplicitry and cost. The primary industry problem they are out to overcome is to untangle the knotted, speghetti processes of global transactions and allow a truly free flow of payments. Their founders have over one hundred years of combined experience in the payments space.
* Patricia Montesi, Founder and CEO - with 20 years of global expereince, Patricia has transformed and grown companies from start-ups to the Fortune 100. 
* Darren Beyer, Founder and Chief Product and Strategy Officer - vast experience in the payments industry with both large software platforms across the channels, to include mobile. He has worked at other FinTech companies in the payments space such as FIS, Blackhawk Network and PayActiv.
* Steven Bishop, Founder and Chief Information Officer - a world-renowned payments expert, he has a deep understanding of systems engineering and design and held executive leadership roles at FIS Prepaid Solutions, WaveCrest Group and WildCard Systems.
* Robert Pincus, Founder and Chief Operating Officer - Robert has also spent time at FIS and Wildcard Systems and has long-time experience across Fortune 500 and start-up companies. He has extensive international payments experience and launched award-winning, multij-currenty payment programs.

Quolo announced in August of 2021 a successful round of Series A funding at $15M USD. The leading investor was The Raptor Group and additional investment coming from professional individual investers and strategic partners. The invester interest and Series A closure was due in large part to the unique value proposition and network effect, as Qolo experienced a rapid pace of client acquisition and a tripling of its staff, including C-Suite hires CFO and CCO. The Series A funding has allowed the company to continue its expansion of talent, new product launches, and increased international specificity. Also, the funding should accelerate the availability of a generally available offering of its current beta version of Qolo's Accelerator program. The Accelorator Program combines a unique client engagement model with quick go-to-market, while maintaining product flexibility, control and monitoring, and efficiencies down the line.

## Value Proposition:

Qolo's target market ranges from small and medium companies, to large corporations that span different verticals, including factoring, trade, fianance, and manufacturing, as well as bundled solutions focused on the contract and earned wage industries. The primary problem Qolo is tackling, is the complexity of global  payments and billables across multiple channels. This is also compounded when integrations with legacy systems is required. Ultimately, the capabilities of their solutions allow for omnichannel payments with direct access to all payments rails, account type, and treasury management through a single API set. As the company states, "We support any paymenrt, any channel, anywhere, and have yet to find a business case we cannot power."

Qolo has developed from the ground up the next new-generation payments processing global system. At its core is a 100% cloud based payments solution, first in the industry according to Qolo.  This is their competative advantage, as they have pioneered the first high-performance payments platform for the new global economy that is easily scalable, portable, reliable, and secure. 

* Scalability is evident within a cloud environment as companies can use what they need and spin up or turn down based on company needs and growth. For example, a critical component in any payments infrastructure is the utilization of Host Security Modules (HSMs), which provide high-performance cryptographic services for enterprise applications and ensure data integrity. HSMs on the Qolo cloud are seen as a service and can be turned up within minutes versus hours and are leveraged, reducing transaction time from 60 milliseconds to one millisecond per transaction.
* Portability in a global payments and transactions environment is also a must, as different geographics bring new and different regulations and tax implications. Therefore, Qolo's cloud based solution truly opens up cloud native technologies for more flexible license options, as it is difficult to find a one-size-fits-all solution. In a traditional seperate licensing instance, it could take months to turn up and implement, whereas Qolo CEO Patricia Montesi states, "We can roll out a new instance in less than a day. While others in the industry can talk about being in the cloud, Qolo is the first to be truly cloud native...".
* The next benefit to Qolo's cloud based solution is reliability. Companies had to manage countless servers to realize payment transactions, but with Qolo, not only is the infrastructure seen as a service, but also the network, transport layer, along with security, is seen as a service. All maintenance and redundancy is managed by Qolo.
* One of the most valued benefits to Qolo's cloud based global payments system is the increase in performace across multiple metrics. Along with cloud-based HSM, Qolo processes data in a "hot-hot" deployment method, which allows two or more servers to receive, send and store transactional information simultaneously. This is a dramatic movement away from traditional "failover" deployment, where payment porocessing is stored, processed, and transfered on a primary server and a copy on a secondary failover server used only if the first fails.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape/Results/Recommendations:

Ultimately, Qolo allows SMB businesses a high valued manner in which to process payments across cards, ACH, Real-time, push and digital wallets. It complies and provides cababilities across several metrics to include, cloud deployment, electronic transfers, cross-boarder transactions, multiple payment options, payment fraud protection, payment processing services integration, PCI compliance, and point-of-sale (POS). This stacks up well against some of Qolo's most reviewed competitors such as Stripe, Recurly, Tipalti, and Digital River to name a few. However, none of these companies comprehensively compares to Qolo across these metrics described above.

This results in a Qolo solution with direct access and removing multiple players within the traditional ecosystem. Qolo stitches together multiple banks, payment rails and account capabiilties all through a single set of APIs, all hosted in a cloud native architecture. Qolo is positioned for continued market growth and network effect as more and more companies adopt their global payment solutions.

What would be interesting is an understanding of how the current Qolo solution is architected and how it is/may be future proofed against decentralized payment solutions. The current solution, as architected, is not apparent and proprietary. An example technology is the capability and partnership Qolo has with SmartFX. SmartFX provides a real-time brokerage of currency pairs and translates that back to the most economic clearing of international transactions. Albeit a cloud based solution, it is apparently very centralized and not developed on a decentralized platform such as a blockchain. It would be interesting to undertand Qolo's roadmap, and partnership with SmartFX, for continued value production and utilization of new blockchain technologies unlocking continued value across fees, scale, security and reliability.
